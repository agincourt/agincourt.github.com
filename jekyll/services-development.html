      <p>Web development is synonymous with engineering - we build systems that simplify tasks for people. Everything from basic contact forms on websites through to social networks, payment processing, mining datasets and much more can be built into websites, web applications and web services.</p>
      
      <p>The more complex and extensive the functionality, the more critical it is that you hire a professional firm with experience in delivering reliable, fault-tolerant and secure systems.</p>
      
      <p>As projects grow and evolve, decisions may alter, whether it's changes in competition, budgets or knowledge, or simply things that don't work as well in practice as on paper. That's why we follow an agile methodology and get the basics of your application up and running as quickly as possible so you can start providing feedback.</p>
      
      <p>Agincourt build applications in a variety of technologies including <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Objective-C</a> - we focus on using the right tool for the job.</p>

      <p class="intro">EMCfL is a training and meeting venue based on the fringe Grantham. It’s location is ideal for people travelling from all around the UK, due to Grantham’s excellent transport connections - the A1 and the East Coast trainline (covering York - Leeds - London).</p>
      <p>The target market of the site was fairly wide although a large portion may be receptionists, PAs and office managers who will be looking through a potentially large quantity of venues, so the site had to capture their attention and quickly promote the venue. Agincourt focused on the key features with the large banner rotation, list of benefits and also placed call to action buttons throughout the site to encourage people to take the next steps towards making an enquiry.</p>

      <p class="intro">Farm and Field are a broker for farming-oriented financial, energy and insurance services. Moving away from the typical drudgery that is corporate-style websites, Agincourt developed a more traditional farming theme for the website to make the brand stand out and provide a more memorable experience for the visitors.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Agincourt were very helpful, holding our hand and guiding us through the various situations, giving good advice so that we ended up with a great looking site. The professional service we have received has made this new endeavour far easier than I could have expected.

        Having worked with other web companies in the past I have experienced a range of levels of service and suffice to say we'll be coming back to Agincourt in the future.&rdquo;</p>

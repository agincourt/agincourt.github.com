  <h1>Tips for taking photos for use on websites</h1>

  <p class="intro">High quality photos don't just come from using expensive SLR cameras, a professional photographer knows how lighting, balance, exposure, angle, background, focal points and much more come into play. So if you fancy saving some money and taking your own photos for use on your website, here are some tips to ensure you get the best possible result.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_6">
  <h2>Light, light and more light</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-light.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="Lightbulb" /></div>

  <p>Professional photographers usually have bright studios with large lamps and expensive flashes.</p>

  <p>You should ensure there is as much light on your object(s) and surroundings as possible - watch out for spotlights though, you generally want an even amount of light across the whole scene, not just in one place.</p>

  <p>If you're taking photos indoors, ensure all your lights are turned on, doors are open to allow more light to flow through and it's a nice bright day outside so more natural light is pouring in. Outside, obviously photos look much better on days with blue skies.</p>

<div class="grid_6">
  <h2>Isolate your object(s)</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-lightbox.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="Shooting in a lightbox" /></div>

  <p>Often, as part of designs, web designers need to cut-out your object and display it on the page, in this case you'll need to ensure the whole object is in view on a single photograph. You should also ensure that the background is as plain as possible to make the cut-out process much quicker.</p>

  <p>If you're shooting a small item, for example a gadget for an online shop, you should look to borrow/hire a light box. These are white boxes with a set of lights inside, designed for shooting items with a pure white background and little to no shadows.</p>

  <h2>Watch out for reflections</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-cat-reflection.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="Reflection of a cat" /></div>
        
  <p>Anywhere with glass, mirrors or water could show your reflection, or reflections of something you don't wish to be in the photo. If you suspect something might reflect, before shooting your proper photos, take a test one and check it.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_6">
  <h2>Shoot away from the light-source</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-glare.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="What not to do: shooting into the light" title="What not to do: shooting into the light" /></div>

  <p>This may seem obvious, but it's often forgotten - ensure your light source is behind you, otherwise it'll glare the camera and you'll get a darker scene, like in this photo.</p>

  <h2>Take plenty of photos</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-memory-cards.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="SD Cards" /></div>

  <p>Digital cameras can hold hundreds of photos with the high density memory cards available today - so don't just take one or two photos and hope they'll be okay, feel free to go trigger crazy.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_6">
  <h2>Use a tripod</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-tripod.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="Using a tripod" /></div>

  <p>With a much more steady camera, you can shoot and lower exposure rates, allowing the camera to take in more light without getting camera shake on the photo.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Use a decent camera</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-slr.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="SLR camera and accessories" /></div>

  <p>Okay, so as mentioned, using an expensive camera won't automatically allow you to take incredible photos, but using a terrible camera, such as those on mobile phones, will definitely limit you.</p>

  <p>When looking for a camera, note that the number of megapixels does not indicate the quality of a camera - it's more about the size of the light sensor and the quality of the lenses.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_6">
  <h2>Think about the scene</h2>

  <div class="figure right"><img src="http://cdn.agincourt.co/images/content/photography-hotel.jpg" width="140" height="105" alt="Cheap hotel sign" /></div>

  <p>With digital cameras it's easy to snap away without really thinking about the image your photo is going to portray.</p>
  <p>On a website, photography is not just used to convey relevance, it needs to illustrate a lifestyle that the visitor wants to have for themselves or their company. For example, a country hotel should look friendly and comforting, a designer kitchen should look crisp, sleek and clean.</p>

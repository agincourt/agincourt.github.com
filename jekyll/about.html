      <h1>About Agincourt</h1>
      
      <p>Agincourt are a professional web application design &amp; development studio.</p>
      
      <p>We specialize in developing projects from an initial spark of an idea, through to fully-functional, thriving applications and successful websites.</p>
      
      <p>Where businesses want to keep things simple by dealing with one company for their web project, yet require expertise throughout - Agincourt deliver. Our client-base spans the United Kingdom, but there is certainly nothing preventing us from handling projects further afield, should it be required.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Apps</h2>

      <p>It's important for web design companies to scratch their own itches and build their own sites/apps to experiment with and learn new techniques and technologies. Here are a few we've built:</p>

      <p>We're fans of the 'best tool for the job' mantra, so we often work with a variety of <a href="/partners-and-services">partners and services</a> which increase the speed of development, reduce risk and offer additional value. Obviously, all projects are different, so we carefully analyse each situation and only use services that are appropriate and client preferences are taken into account where suitable.</p>

      <h2>Why the name 'Agincourt'?</h2>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Our name is derived from the Battle of Agincourt, whereby the much smaller British army triumphed over the French through use of the superior longbow. This use of new technology to overcome problems is a very important aspect of our business.&rdquo;</p>

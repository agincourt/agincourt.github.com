      <p>When people visit a website they have specific tasks in mind, even for casual entertainment sites like YouTube, people want to achieve something, in this case it may be finding a video they're interested in; this is what makes a website more than a series of pretty pictures.</p>
      
      <p>This is also the case for web applications - productivity is linked directly to how quickly and efficiently people can complete tasks.</p>
      
      <p>It's Agincourt's mission to deliver experiences on the web which are not only intuitive and efficient for users, but which achieve maximum satisfaction and are ultimately enjoyable to use!</p>
